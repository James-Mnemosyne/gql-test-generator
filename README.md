## Overview

Writing tests kind of sucks. Hopefully, this makes it a bit easier to get a comprehensive test setup.

I plan on actively maintaining this. Feel free to contribute.

`npm i --save-dev gql-test-generator`

### Yarn

`yarn add -D gql-test-generator`

Currently, there is no use. Planning to make this a CLI tool.
